### What’s the best way to communicate with me?
I'm generally pretty responsive on Slack these days (I even put it back on my phone). I'll be responsive to stuff after work hours (around 6), but if it's urgent or it requires me to set up a meeting or introduce you to someone, I'd prefer an email. If it requires me to not also do something else at the same time, let's hop on the phone. 

If I don’t respond, try texting me!

### I'd love to help you with ____
Your computer security. Yeah, I know password management and yubikeys aren't very fun, but it is very important to me. 

### What makes me grumpy?

	
### How do I like to give feedback?
I prefer to give feedback over the phone or in-person. In the past, I've had (monthly or biweekly, usually) one-on-ones with team members where we talked about the project, life, and I had a chance to provide feedback.

### How do I like to receive feedback?
I prefer to receive feedback in-person or over the phone as well, usually as it comes up if there's something urgent or that I'm not doing right.

### One of my goals for the project:
Work-related: Learn from y'all about how you approach user research/experience design, the tools you use, and what methods you find most helpful. 
Non-work: Given all the trips we're going to be on, learn how to pack more efficiently. 

### Topics I’m always happy to talk about:
I really love talking about food. Your favorite thing to cook, geeking out over recipes or techniques, or learning about new cuisines. I'm also a huge comic geek, so if you're interested in the medium I'm happy to talk to you about the books I've loved.

### Other things you might want to know:

* My favorite baked good:
* Spouses/partners/kiddos/pets: I live with my wonderful girlfriend, Kaeti, and our pet turtle, Soup.
* Fruit on pizza? I used to be a hard no, but then I realized I love tacos al pastor (pork tacos with pineapple on them). It felt hypocritical for me to be so anti-fruit on pizza, so now I'm a "not for me, but I won't judge you for doing it."
* My coffee order: Iced dirty chai latte. 
* My hometown: Greensboro, North Carolina
* Sports loyalties: None that I get too worked up over except for the Mexican Men's National Soccer team.
* Favorite movie/book/podcast: Jurassic Park/the Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay/Still Processing
* My favorite GIF: ![Sup](https://media.giphy.com/media/ypqHf6pQ5kQEg/giphy.gif)
