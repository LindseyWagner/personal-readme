## How to work with raph

### What’s the best way to communicate with me?
I'm generally pretty responsive on Slack these days (I even put it back on my phone). I'll be responsive to stuff after work hours (around 6), but if it's urgent or it requires me to set up a meeting or introduce you to someone, I'd prefer an email. If it requires me to not also do something else at the same time, let's hop on the phone. 

If I don’t respond, shoot me another email or ping me again on Slack. You're not bugging me, I promise. 

### I'd love to help you with: 
Your computer security. Yeah, I know password management and yubikeys aren't very fun, but it is very important to me. 

I've done product management in the past and enjoyed it, so I like talking about understanding your users/audience and what your vision is for the product you're working on.

### What makes me grumpy?
Pedestrians that hog all the sidewalk or decide to stop suddenly. 

Related to work, I don't love circling back on decisions that have already been made unless there's a great reason. I get grumpy when there's gatekeeping or someone acts as a bottleneck. I also like to make sure people are heard in meetings and will call folks out if they're interrupting a bit too often.
	
### How do I like to give feedback?
If it's about a doc or something we're working on, I'll probably use Slack or email to provide feedback. But, if it's something a bit bigger then I prefer to give feedback in-person or on the phone. In the past, I've had (monthly or biweekly, usually) one-on-ones with team members where we talked about the project, life, and I had a chance to provide feedback.

### How do I like to receive feedback?
I prefer to receive feedback in-person or over the phone as well, usually as it comes up if there's something urgent or that I'm not doing right. I'm open to receiving it any time, really, so please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd rather you let me know than stressing out about it. 

Also, if you're not comfortable speaking to me directly, please reach out to Afua. I want to make sure you're comfortable speaking up. 

### One of my goals for the project:
Work-related: Learn from y'all about how you approach user research/experience design, the tools you use, and what methods you find most helpful. 
Non-work: Given all the trips we're going to be on, learn how to pack more efficiently. 

### Topics I’m always happy to talk about:
I really love talking about food. Your favorite thing to cook, geeking out over recipes or techniques, or learning about new cuisines. I'm also a huge comic geek, so if you're interested in the medium I'm happy to talk to you about the books I've loved. And podcasts. Love talking about the newest podcast you've fallen in love with.

### Other things you might want to know:

* Food I have strong opinions about: Nachos. Ask me about my nacho manifesto if you'd like to learn more.
* Spouses/partners/kiddos/pets: I live with my wonderful girlfriend, Kaeti, and our pet turtle, Soup.
* Fruit on pizza? I used to be a hard no, but then I realized I love tacos al pastor (pork tacos with pineapple on them). It felt hypocritical for me to be so anti-fruit on pizza, so now I'm a "not for me, but I won't judge you for doing it."
* My coffee order: Iced dirty chai latte. 
* My hometown: Greensboro, North Carolina
* Sports loyalties: None that I get too worked up over except for the Mexican Men's National Soccer team.
* Favorite movie/book/podcast: Jurassic Park/the Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay/Still Processing
