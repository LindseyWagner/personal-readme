## How to work with lindsey

### What’s the best way to communicate with me?
I'm really responsive during normal work hours on most any platform - Slack, email, text, gchat, phone, hangout. I prefer slacks if you need a quick dialogue, hangouts if it's messy and asana if you just want me to get a thing done. 

If I don’t respond, text or call me (esp if it's not normal hours but it's urgent.) 

### I'd love to help you with: 
Evaluating an idea or poking holes at something. 
Thinking through interviews...before or after.
Planning a surprise (any good natured surprise for any human or loved being/organism!)
Planning a trip.
Making a mask (one to wear, not clean your skin.)

I like learning about and understanding new problems. I will definitely want to know it better or disrupt it. If I start overthinking something or you want me to stop helping you, you may have to tell me. 

### What makes me grumpy?
Drivers that are mean to bikers. Bikers that think they always have the right away. Pedestrians on their phone ignoring their own safety. And any scooter in the bike lane (just doesn't jive.) 

(Stole this from Raph but super agree) Related to work, I don't love circling back on decisions that have already been made unless there's a solid reason. 

I don't like forwarded emails with no context and tend to ignore them. So if the context isn't obvious, just let me know a bit more if you can!
	
### How do I like to give feedback?
If it's a shared doc, I prefer using commenting features that provide notifcations and replies. If there isn't a way to comment, I'll shoot an email or asana incase folks can't get to it right away . If it's urgent but small, maybe a slack. If it's something a bit bigger, I prefer to give feedback in-person or a video chat/phone call.  Regular team checkins are great! I am known to give realtime feedback if there isn't a forum or reflection period designated for the team. Although I'm happy to adjust to other folks desired styles.

I also tend to singtalk or dance when I get real comfortable with a crew. Some feedback might be in the form of song or movement. I hope that's ok... it's fairly involuntary at this point.

### How do I like to receive feedback?
I'm open to realtime feedback. I do like to understand feedback so if I seem tense (I'm usually thinking) or if I ask questions it's usually cause I'm wondering how to best use your feedback. 

If it's super personal, I defintely prefer a one on one but I am not embarrassed to reflect and respond to a larger group after I have a moment to absorb the feedback. 

### One of my goals for the project:
Work-related: Learn from the team's prior experiences and our collaborations. I'm also eager to learn from folks we'll be interviewing and think about how I can extend this experience to communities I volunteer with.

Non-work: Learn how to get more exercise in while traveling. 

### Topics I’m always happy to talk about:
I really love talking about performance ideas or art projects or art you've seen that blew your mind. I love learning about nature and biology... so I may talk your ear off about animals, ecosystems or natural things we happen upon. I also love talking about podcasts or listening to the same one and freaking out togehter as we tune in!

### Other things you might want to know:

* I perform/puppeteer... and may have shows this fall if you'd like to see one :) 
* Spouses/partners/kiddos/pets: I have a rad partner who I dont live with but you may meet. His name is Tim. I have no children but get along with kids and will regularly be distracted by them! I have no pets because I am renting/traveling (I did have a turtle and a dog back in the day!) but I have plants that are basically green babies.
* I volunteer as I can with an immigration accompanient network in Boston (it's not focused on legal permanent residents though.)
* I'm supposed to stay away from dairy but you'll catch me breaking that rule on the norm cause it's so delicious. 
* My hometown: Indianapolis, IN but I also grew up in Tokyo and near Atlanta.
